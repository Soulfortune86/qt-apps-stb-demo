# Set-top box demo

This demo shows a simple set-top box style interface with the ability to
browse films and watch trailers, browse the web, and access HbbTV content.

## Compiling

Prerequisites:

* Qt 5.8.0 or later
* Qt WebEngine module for web browsing (optional)
* Qt WebKit module for HbbTV support (optional)

The demo also requires API keys for accessing YouTube and TMDb. Hardcoded keys
are provided via a QML file in a Git submodule which is accessible only to
The Qt Company. If the file is not present, users will be prompted to enter
API keys via an in-app Settings menu, which will be persisted to the device's
local settings store.
